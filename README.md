# GLOTCH -- an image manipulation software that purposefully 'glitches' images in order to create computer generated art. Its features include:

* Fully functioning GUI
* Multiple different functions with user-controlled random seeds
* Innuendo-packed error messages
* Undo
* Shrubbery-inspired window icons

# Has several dependencies in order to get working!

It will need PIL for sure. As we created this program a year and a half ago we can't recall the exact neccessities, though there aren't that many. If you are dedicated enough to go through the motions of getting it to work, please send a pull request updating this readme with the steps! Max will do it if he gets the time, but who knows when that is.
